ðŸ‘‹ gm! I am Newix from France.

I have been a tech / web2 engineer and entrepreneur for 15 years.
I have the deep regret to have entered web3 a few months too late to witness the birth of the amazing, enthralling Loot ecosystem. That is probably one of the element fueling my motivation to build [Portals & Passages](https://www.portalsnpassages.com/), a project I initiated in January 2022.

âš™ My overarching goal with my work is to build systems that live and last beyond me.
With [Portals & Passages](https://www.portalsnpassages.com/), I would like to provide a component fitting well in the Lootverse and being a enabler for connecting other projects and offering new game mechanics possibilities.
But drawing inspiration from the excellent [Crypts & Caverns](https://threepwave.com/cryptsandcaverns) project, I would like to make [Portals & Passages](https://www.portalsnpassages.com/) sufficiently generic to be compatible with other on-chain ecosystems in the future (this explains why "Loot" isn't part of the project name).
